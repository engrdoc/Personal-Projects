# Personal-Projects

These are projects I have worked on individually to practice and harness my programming skills in Python using predominantly Google Colab environment.

LottoMax-6Digit - I tried to use a simple linear regression model to determine the possible combination of numbers (6 Digits from 1 - 50) based on a set of winning lottery combinations drawn over a period of time. An improvement has to be made in terms of eliminating the previously drawn number(s) from the data set when it estimates the correlation as part of the iterative regression.
